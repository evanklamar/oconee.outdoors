            <p>We opened our doors in 2024 to provide visitors to the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest with a wide array of equipment and activities to help them get the most out of their visit! We offer such rentals as camping equipment, fishing equipment, mountain bikes, kayaks, paddleboards, and anything else that we think could help people experience all the wonders that the forest has in store.</p>
            <p>In addition to renting out equipment, we also host group excursions into the Chattahoochee-Oconee for hiking, kayaking, and more! If you're interested in seeing the forest with us, check out our <a href="excursions.html">excursions page</a> to see what we have planned for the spring of 2025. We'd love to see you there!</p>

            <h2>About the Chattahoochee-Oconee</h2>
            <div class="about">
            <img src="images/about2.png" alt="about the forest">
            <p>The Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest spans 867,265 acres of protected land in the mountains of North Georgia. It has land in 18 counties and includes over 2200 miles of rivers and streams, and over 450 miles of recreational trails. One of the most well-known hiking trails in the US, the Appalachian Trail, has its southern terminus in this forest! The forest takes its name from the two major rivers that have their sources within its boundaries: the Chattahoochee, which drains into the Gulf of Mexico, and the Oconee, which drains into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
            <p>Numerous animals can be found in the forest, including birds such as hawks, owls, blackbirds, ducks, eagles, sparrows, hummingbirds, geese, and cardinals. Mammalian species that roam in the forest include American black bears, shrews, coyotes, bats, squirrels, beavers, river otters, bobcats, deer, weasels, mice, and foxes. It's also home to the rare Blue Ghost firefly, which can only be found in this region of the Appalachian mountains!</p>

            <h2>Forest Amenities</h2>
            <div class="about">
            <img src="images/about3.png" alt="forest amenities">
            <p>As a national forest, the Chattahoochee-Oconee is not built for human visitors the same way a national park or state park would be. Outside dedicated campgrounds and ranger stations, it contains no built amenities like restrooms, trash receptacles, or water pumps. Make sure you come prepared, especially if you're planning an extended hiking or camping trip. We hope you safely enjoy all the natural wonders that this forest has to offer!</p>
            <p>The Chattahoochee-Oconee is federally protected land, which means that we should all do our part to preserve this beautiful natural landscape and the wildlife that calls it home. Don't leave anything behind at your campsite, and hold on to any trash you create until it can be disposed of at designated receptacles.</p>
